        <p>Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky 4 April 1932[1] â€“ 29 December 1986) was a Soviet filmmaker. Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time, his films explore spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory.</p>

      <h2>Childhood and early life</h2>
      <p>Andrei Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast (modern-day Kadyysky District of the Kostroma Oblast, Russia) to the poet and translator <span class="link">Arseny Aleksandrovich Tarkovsky</span>, a native of Yelysavethrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine), and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute who later worked as a corrector; she was born in Moscow in the Dubasov family estate.</p> 
      <img src="https://www.sensesofcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2002/05/Andrei-Tarkovsky.png" alt="Andrei Tarkovsky Portrait"/>
      <p>According to the family legend, Tarkovsky's ancestors on his father's side were princes from the <span class="link">Shamkhalate of Tarki</span>, Dagestan, although his sister Marina Tarkovskaya who did a detailed research on their genealogy called it "a myth, even a prank of sorts," stressing that none of the documents confirms this version.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article>
      <h2>Film school student</h2>
      <p>Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the State Institute of Cinematography ðŸŽ¥ and was admitted to the film-directing program. He was in the same class as Irma Raush whom he married in April 1957.</p>
      <p>The early Khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the <span class="link">Italian neorealists</span>, <span class="link">French New Wave</span>, and of directors such as Kurosawa, BuÃ±uel, Bergman, Bresson, Wajda (whose film Ashes and Diamonds influenced Tarkovsky) and Mizoguchi.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>ðŸ’¡ Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Tarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by <em>Japanese films</em>. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight. Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in <em>art of Haiku</em> and its ability to create "images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves"</p>

    <article>
      <h2>Famous Movies</h2>
      <p>Tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director. During his career he directed seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. His features are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ivan's Childhood (1962)</li>
        <li>Andrei Rublev (1966)</li>
        <li>Solaris (1972)</li>
        <li>Mirror (1975)</li>
        <li>Stalker (1979)</li>
        <li>Nostalghia (1983)</li>
        <li>The Sacrifice (1986)</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>He also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he directed the play Hamlet for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera Boris Godunov in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story Turnabout by William Faulkner. He also wrote Sculpting in Time, a book on film theory.</p>
      <p>Tarkovsky's first feature film was Ivan's Childhood in 1962. He then directed Andrei Rublev in 1966, Solaris in 1972, Mirror in 1975 and Stalker in 1979. The documentary <em>Voyage in Time</em> was produced in Italy in 1982, as was Nostalghia in 1983. His last film The Sacrifice was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said: "A director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.""</p>

          <div class="block">
            <p>
              <span class="first-character">I</span>n 1978, Brian Smith landed
              in Southern California with a bag of sheepskin boots and hope. He
              fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was convinced the
              world would one day share this love. The beaches of Southern
              California had long been an epicenter of a relaxed, casual
              lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit for his
              brand. So he founded the UGG brand, began selling his sheepskin
              boots and they were an immediate sensation. By the mid 1980's, the
              UGG brand became a symbol of relaxed southern California culture,
              gaining momentum through surf shops and other shops up and down
              the coast of California, from San Diego to Santa Cruz. UGG boots
              reached beyond the beach, popping up in big cities and small towns
              all over, and in every level of society. Girls wore their surfer
              boyfriend's pair of UGG boots like a letterman jacket. When winter
              came along, UGG boots were in ski shops and were seen in lodges
              from Mammoth to Aspen.
            </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">
              The UGG brand began to symbolize those who embraced sport and a
              relaxed, active lifestyle. More than that, an emotional connection
              and a true feeling of love began to grow for UGG boots, just as
              Brian had envisioned. People didn't just like wearing UGG boots,
              they fell in love with them and literally could not take them off.
              By the end of the 90's, celebrities and those in the fashion world
              took notice of the UGG brand. A cultural shift occurred as well -
              people were embracing, and feeling empowered, by living a more
              casual lifestyle and UGG became one of the symbols of this
              lifestyle. By 2000, a love that began on the beaches had become an
              icon of casual style. It was at this time that the love for UGG
              grew in the east, over the Rockies and in Chicago. In 2000, UGG
              Sheepskin boots were first featured on Oprah's Favorite ThingsÂ®
              and Oprah emphatically declared that she "LOOOOOVES her UGG
              boots." From that point on, the world began to notice.
