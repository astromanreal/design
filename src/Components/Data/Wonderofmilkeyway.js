      "description": "The Pillars of Creation are a group of towering columns of gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula. The pillars are about 7 light-years long and are home to many young stars. The pillars are being eroded by the strong winds from nearby stars, and they are expected to dissipate within the next few million years.",

      "description": "The Crab Nebula is the remnant of a supernova that was seen in 1054. The supernova was so bright that it could be seen during the day, and it is thought to have been caused by the collapse of a massive star. The nebula is now about 1,500 light-years from Earth, and it is still expanding.",
