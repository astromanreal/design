        "description": "The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe. It states that the universe was once in an extremely hot and dense state that expanded rapidly. This expansion caused the universe to cool and eventually form the stars and galaxies that we see today."

        "id": 2,
        "theory": "The Theory of General Relativity",
        "description": "The Theory of General Relativity is a theory of gravity developed by Albert Einstein. It states that gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the mass and energy of objects. This curvature causes objects to be attracted to each other."

        "theory": "The Theory of Special Relativity",
        "description": "The Theory of Special Relativity is a theory of space and time developed by Albert Einstein. It states that space and time are not absolute, but rather are relative to the observer. This means that different observers can measure different values for the speed of light and the passage of time."

        "description": "The Standard Model of Particle Physics is a theory that describes the fundamental particles and forces of nature. It states that there are four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force. The Standard Model also states that there are 12 fundamental particles: six quarks, six leptons, and the Higgs boson."

        "description": "The Inflationary Universe Theory is a theory that proposes that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion in the very early universe. This expansion would have caused the universe to grow exponentially, creating a vast and diverse universe."

        "theory": "Cyclic cosmology",
        "description": "Cyclic cosmology is a theory that proposes that the universe is cyclical, with each universe ending in a black hole and beginning anew with another explosion. This would create an infinite number of parallel universes."

        "theory": "Simulation hypothesis",
        "description": "The simulation hypothesis is the idea that our universe is not real, but rather a simulation created by a more advanced civilization. If this is the case, then there could be an infinite number of parallel universes, each of which is a simulation created by a different civilization."
